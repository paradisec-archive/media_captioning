## What type of access could be offered and when?
1. Captioning pre-recorded content:
* When lectures, meetings, seminars, or workshops are recorded live and with no deaf people or others needing captions present in the audience, these presentations can be captioned after the event and made available to the public
* Pre-recorded videos presented at a conference can be captioned prior to sending to conference organisers. Making a captioned version available would greatly improve access to your content

2. Live captioning and/or interpreting: When deaf or hard-of hearing colleagues would like to participate and interact live in lectures, meetings, seminars, or workshops, you should make sure they have access to one of the following (these services may be provided by the participantâ€™s home institution, but this should not be assumed, as affiliation does not guarantee access):
* **Live captions or transcriptions (onsite or remote)** - captions or transcriptions created by a human which can be done onsite or remotely. One method of live transcribing is referred to in the USA as CART (Communication Access Real-Time Translation). Another is STTR (Speech-to-Text Relay) in the UK. Both terms refer to the same output. The methods used to achieve either may be different, e.g., stenograph versus respeaking, which can affect the quality of captions produced. The output may be presented as captions, or as a transcription projected onto a screen or sent directly to the laptop of the participant
* **Sign language interpreters** â€“ qualified sign language interpreters can be booked to provide access for signing deaf people who use interpreters. A major benefit is that interpreters facilitate two-way interaction in real time, enabling everyone to access each other. Captions will only work one-way between people with sensorial asymmetries, e.g., between people who do not sign and deaf people who do not speak. Sign language interpreting is a very personal process and quality can vary widely. It is a good idea to liaise directly with the deaf person to find out what language, service and interpreters they prefer to use. See page 10 for more information on booking and working with sign language interpreters.
