This page offers advice for those who wish to prepare audio files for archiving with PARADISEC. The target format we accept is **.wav (96kHz/24-bit, stereo).** There is also helpful suggestions on other actions pertaining to audio manipulation and extracting audio from video.

## Tools for audio editing or manipulation

* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) - This is a tool for audio editing and recording. It is free and quite easy to use
* [Audition](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/audition.html) - If you have access to the Adobe Creative Cloud, or just Audition, this is a great tool to use. it is similar to Audacity, but it is a bit more powerful; it allows for easy batch processing and creating preset tasks and interacts nicely with the other Adobe media tools (like Premiere). This is not free- it requires a subscription for use
* [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) - Although ffmpeg is mostly known as a video processing tool, you can extract audio from video as well as manipulate your audio tracks (resample, mono -> stereo, boost volume, etc.) You can run across a full directory of files, or just one file at a time. ffmpeg is free and you will need to use the terminal to run it
* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) - VLC is also mosly known as a video player, but you can easily extract audio from video using VLC. It is also free to use
